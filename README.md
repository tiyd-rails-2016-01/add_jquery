# Add JQuery

## Description

Given an existing application, add JQuery to give a page more functionality.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand how JQuery fits into the Rails asset pipeline.
* Be able to create simple JQuery behaviors.
* Be able to implement a date select field.
* Be able to implement a modal window.

## Deliverables

* **A Repository.** You will all be forking the code from an existing application.  Your instructor will provide that link.

## Normal Mode

For this assignment, you will continue to modify Coursyl, an existing open source application.  This application has a course detail page which lists (among other things) all the assignments for the course.  Each assignment has two datetimes: `active_at` and `due_at`.  Although the application has a page for editing an assignment, dates shift like crazy due to snow days.  The users would like a quick way to edit just the start and end dates on an assignment.

You must add the following JQuery functionality to this page:

* Refactor all of your existing Javascript code to use JQuery.
* Add a link (which looks like an icon) to each row of the assignments table.  Choose an icon which seems reasonable for changing dates.
* When the user clicks on that link, they should NOT leave the page.  They should see a modal popup appear hovering over the page, and it should have two fields: `active_at` and `due_at`.
* There should also be a button for submitting this modal form.  On submit, it is fine if the page loads.  Feel free to submit this form to `assignments/update`.
* The date fields should not be simple text fields.  Instead, when you place the cursor in the box, it should display a visual calendar nearby and allow you to pick a date AND TIME from it.  A simple date selector is included by default, but you need to use your Googling skills to find a good looking datetime selector which you can implement.

Note that this application currently uses Bootstrap 2.  Bootstrap has modal functionality built into it, so you should use those components to create this modal.  Also note that Bootstrap 2 has Fontawesome built into it, so you should use that font set to pick out an icon for the link to the modal.

## Hard Mode

Rather than using Bootstrap's built-in modal functionality, build your own modal from scratch.  It should include an X link to close the modal, a cancel button to close the modal, and it should grey out and prevent you from clicking on other parts of the page visible behind it.
